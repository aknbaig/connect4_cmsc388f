You will be asked for a screen which will ask if you would like to go first or second. After this you will recieve prompts asking where you would like to drop the pieces (currently you must select where to drop the piece for both the player and the computer). The game will eventually declare a winner, which it will output to a screen, after it determines if the Player or the Computer has lined up 4 tokens onto the board. The player tokens are marked as 'P' and the computer tokens are marked as 'C'.
